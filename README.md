## Nodeflow

A library that aims to provide everything needed for making flowcharts, graphs, diagrams, and other similar things using
a simple and intuitive API.
Currently, Nodeflow is built using [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/), but there are plans to make it
framework-agnostic in the future.

## Installation

The only way to install Nodeflow as of now is to clone the repository and build it yourself. This will be changed in the
future.

## Usage

A wiki page will be created soon to explain how to use Nodeflow.

## Examples

There are 2 example projects: [FamilyTreeApp](./FamilyTreeApp) and [FlowchartApp](./BlueprintApp).
To run them, you need to build Nodeflow first, and link it to the example projects.
