## NodeFlow

A library that aims to provide everything needed for making flowcharts, graphs, diagrams, and other similar things using
a simple and intuitive API.
Currently, NodeFlow is built using [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/), but there are plans to make it
framework-agnostic in the future.

## Installation

The only way to install NodeFlow as of now is to clone the repository and build it yourself. This will be changed in the
future.

## Usage

A wiki page will be created soon to explain how to use NodeFlow.

## Examples

There are 2 example projects: [FamilyTreeApp](./examples/FamilyTreeApp) and [FlowchartApp](./examples/BlueprintApp).
To run them, you need to build NodeFlow first, and link it to the example projects.
