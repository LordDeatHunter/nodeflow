A library that aims to provide everything needed for making flowcharts, graphs, diagrams, and other similar things using
a simple and intuitive API.\
Currently, NodeFlow is built using [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/), but there are plans to make it
framework-agnostic in the future.

### Features

- Zooming and panning
- Dragging, selecting, and connecting nodes
- Fully customizable styling for every element (nodes, connectors, connector-sections, etc.)
- Customizable node content
- History (undo/redo)
- Connection curves

## Installation

```shell
npm install nodeflow
```

## Usage

A wiki page will be created soon to explain how to use NodeFlow.

## Examples

There are 2 example projects: [FamilyTreeApp](./examples/FamilyTreeApp) and [FlowchartApp](./examples/BlueprintApp).\
For the time being, the examples are not hosted anywhere, so you will have to clone the repository and run them locally.
